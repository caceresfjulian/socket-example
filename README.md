# socket-example (msg-queue-version branch)
Over here, there's no socket connection implemented. Instead, a basic queue of messages is simulated.

## Getting Started
To run this project, you'll need to install Node.js and NPM. Once you have these tools installed, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Open a new terminal window and navigate to the socket-client directory.
6. Run ```npm install```to install the client dependencies.
7. Run ```npm start``` to start the React app.

### Directory Structure
The socket-client shows some basic features:

- Class based components and their life cycle methods.

- A simple MessageQueue class which generates a random message every n amount of seconds.
